# Working with services

Your task is to implement a `login` method in `AuthenticationService` and `findByEmail` method in `UserService`.
More details are described in comments over the methods.

To verify your solution please run `main` method in `Main` class. The output in console should be the following:
```
Test passed for email: bob@i.ua and password 1234
Test passed for email: alice@i.ua and password 1234
Test passed for email: john@i.ua and password 1234
Test passed for email: bob@i.ua and password qwerty
```
**NOTE:** please do not modify the `Main` class.
